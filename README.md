Poset Drawing


Draws Posets. Currently I don't have a good input method other than just manually entering in the Poset.

Buttons in order from top to down on left panel are:
  Initialize poset with all nodes on top of each other
  Heuristic #1: calculate chains and try to arrange them symmetrically
  Heuristic #2: Try to make the hull of the poset first, and fill in on inside
  Randomly initialize psoet
  Start physical simulation, try to minimize energy
  Pause physical simulation
  
Can also drag around points manually if one sees some nice symmetry.

Created in fall of 2016.
